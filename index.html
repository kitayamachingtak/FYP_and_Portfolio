In the traditional view, parents prefer their children to be engineers or doctors, I was a member of science and technology student in secondary school. Since everyone regards learning computers as a good future, I study computer-related majors at the City University of Hong Kong. Although the name of my degree is called Bachelor of Science in creative media, in fact, most of the courses are offered by the School of Computer Science and we study together with computer science students. The prospect of this major is games or human-computer interaction, and my direction is in computer graphics. The cross-department course led to the fact that the competition for grades was very cruel, and the workload of the courses was also very heavy. But fortunately, my computer science course grades are still good. I even get on Dean's list at the end of 2020.

The opportunity for me to begin to change my attitude towards the social science and related discipline starts from a summer internship. In the summer of my sophomore year, I worked as an intern at a gigantic Internet company. There the interns have to work overtime until the early hours of the morning, and they are sometimes insulted by the department manager. After I quit my internship, with the help of my seniors, I went to an insurance company in Hong Kong to help them process data. Compared with the last employer, I have received more respect here. However, I also noticed that the working environment of secretaries in the company is very poor. Even during the epidemic period, 30 or 40 of them are still crowded in the same classroom-sized space, working every day, only earning more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars per month. I gradually realized that, in fact, I am respected here more because my senior is the leader here, not because of me personally.

Later, as I stayed in this company for a longer time, my seniors taught me some financial knowledge, such as huge profitable derivatives trading, and stories of some financial advisers recommending high-risk investment products to the old and to the poor, and finally, they lose all their money. In these companies, most people turned a blind eye to these incidents, but these stories aroused my interest in social justice and public policies related to labor protection. After the summer internship, I applied for a minor in public policy, although it made my life even busier. Sometimes I query myself why I need to spend more time and money to learn a profession that is "useless" ipoint of view, as majors related to computer science have become more and more popular and their future salaries are getting higher and higher, there is no shortage of excellent modelers or programmers in this field. But proten some people's minds. But I already have the answer. In my point of view, as majors related to computer science have become more and more popular and their future salaries are getting higher and higher, there is no shortage of excellent modelers or programmers in this field. But protection for both labor and poor people is still not in place, which proves that more social science researchers with a sense of justice are still needed.
